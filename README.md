# Basic-Virtual-Library-System-OOP
Design and Implementation of a virtual library system using the principles  of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The system will allow users to manage a  collection of books and perform operations like adding books, removing books,  and searching for books by various criteria. I used C++ for System Implementation in this Assignment.
